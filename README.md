FINAL PROJECT 2
This final project 2 aims to create an automated hydroponic system that can optimize plant growth by utilizing IoT technology. T
he system is designed to monitor and control important parameters such as pH, air temperature, and nutrient levels in real-time. 
Sensors will collect data, which is then processed by a microcontroller to automate nutrient delivery and activate other devices such as pumps or lights. 
The resulting data is also displayed on a web-based dashboard for easy remote monitoring and management, thereby increasing efficiency, productivity, and the desire to match hydroponic planting.
